UPDATES (Assignment 5)

1. LEVEL
Level 0 is autoscrolling, and continues until the player runs out of time.
Projectiles/emitters are not yet implemented, so the player earns time by
 colliding with enemies.
 
2. CAMERA
Level scrolling is accomplished by creating a Camera object. It has a position and
 size to determine what sprites can be drawn. Created cameras are state specific and
 are registered with the General repository. The draw function for Sprites uses the
 active camera's (or a dummy camera's if none exists) position to calculate where it should
 be drawn on the screen.
Sprites have an additional property, ScrollFactor, which is used for parallax scrolling
 (background objects move slower relative to the camera)

For the scrolling level, the camera follows an invisible focus point, with the player
 matching it's speed. Enemies move relative to the world, not the camera, and are recycled
 whenever they move past the left side or are destroyed. The background and ground is
 stationary, with "movement" being simulated by camera movement and ScrollFactors. Scenery
 sprites that move offscreen are moved to the other side, to create a looping stage.
