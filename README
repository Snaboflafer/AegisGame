Assignment 12

Updated boss fight (improved ai, new graphic)
Basic story cutscenes added (replaces static graphics before each level)
Various juice added (particles, sfx, etc.)

Changes after Demo feedback:
-Player will no longer collide with enemies during invuln time, preventing the player from being
	trapped in a corner.
-Ship/Mech weapons and mobility rebalanced, to encourage players to use both
	-Ship weapon damage reduced, but fires multiple shots per attack. Enemies are easier to hit,
		with little change in DPS
	-Mech damage reduced, and fire rate / shot speed increased. Mech still defeats weak enemies in a
		a single hit, but has an easier time hitting them, while DPS against large enemies relatively
		unchanged. Mech jetpack was buffed to be more responsive and have longer duration, allowing
		players to more easily hit high up enemies.
-Fixed issue with collisions not being resolved when a large group is involved.
	-As a result, more particles act dynamically with the world (smoke/dirt collide with stage,
		bullets display animation on hit.
-Fixed bug with cutscenes that occured after a Game Over or when skipping a stage.
-Updated collision boxes on boss, so that is more appropriately damaged when shot.
